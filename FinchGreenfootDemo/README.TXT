This scenario is a demo scenario for the finch, showing off its abilities.
It contains the following features:

- Arrows that show the direction of movement of the finch (use the arrow keys to control the movement).
- Light control, drag these sliders to change the proportion of red, green and blue in the finch's LEDs.
- Acceleration display, this shows the X, Y and Z values of the finch's accelerometer.
- Compass display, this points up when the finch's beak points north (be sure to calibrate the compass first).
- Obstacle display, this is the green block that turns red when the finch detects an obstacle in front of it.
- Light meter, this is displayed under the green block and compass. It turns blacker the darker it is and whiter the lighter it is.
- Buzzer, click this to cause the finch to buzz.
